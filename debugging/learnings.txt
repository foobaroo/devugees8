It is frustrating, to not find the bug that prevents my app from executing properly
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- switch off the laptop and wait for my subconsciousness to give
  me the solution when I am asleep
- read the code again (... and again)
	-> go step by step what you have accomplished so far
- look for help -> show my code to someone or something
- console.log out variables for the logging purpose
- using the debugger
	- find a line in your code, where you want to stop the 
	  execution (maybe even earlier in the code)
	- usually, you want to see the value of a certain variable
	- set the breakpoint
	- run the program (frontend or backend)
	- wait for the debugger to stop your program
	- look at the variables in the callstack -> find your variable and analyze it
- if you copy/paste code, try to understand first
- google 
	-> stackoverflow
	-> mozilla devolper tutorials
	-> blogs
	-> forums
	-> codepen
- questioning myself, if am doing it ENTIRELY WRONG. take an online course for the topic
	-> udemy
	-> pluralsight
	-> codeacademy
	-> greenhouse
	-> codeschool
	-> vesbos
- trial and error
	-> try the same idea with different way of coding
- take a white sheet of paper and draw my thoughts
	-> flowchart
- start from scratch again
- read the boring/frustrating/weired error messages
	-> what does my computer try to tell me?
	-> what does my IDE try to tell me?

	1. console on the backend
	2. console on the browser
	3. console of your IDE
	4. network monitor
	5. cookie inspector
	6. HTML sources -> does my page look correct
- kill the server/browser, restart the OS
- collapse/expand
- make sure you are 
	- in the right workspace/folder
	- on the right database
	- you have opened the right URL
	- you have set the correct paths for your resources
- drink a coffee, relax, meditate, watch netflix, playstation 4, computer game, swimming
